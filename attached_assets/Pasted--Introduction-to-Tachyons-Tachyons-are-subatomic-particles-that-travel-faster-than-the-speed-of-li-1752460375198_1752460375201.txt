✧ Introduction to Tachyons
Tachyons are subatomic particles that travel faster than the speed of light. They are particles that infuse physical matter with spiritual light, creating harmony at every level of being – the highest frequency particle that can be paired with matter. They are considered a direct connection to Source and the first particles created when the universe came into existence.

✧ What Is a Tachyon Chamber?
A Tachyon Chamber is a precisely attuned organic technology designed to receive tachyon particles from higher dimensions. It uses no power or electricity. This quantum healing technology creates an environment for tachyon exposure as well as easier access to the zero-point field and elevated levels of consciousness. It can be used for healing on any and all levels as well as manifestation.
The Tachyon belt that represents the border between the entropic and syntropic universe is now surrounding our planet. High energy cosmic rays enter this Solar system from interstellar space and carry tachyons with them. Some of these tachyons reach the surface of our planet through a hyperdimensional wormhole that we have created with a quartz oscillator crystal aboard Genesis II spacecraft and these tachyons can be utilized in our Tachyon chamber that we have developed in cooperation with the Pleiadians. This special Tachyon chamber enables the arrival of tachyons from higher dimensions into physical matter.
Tachyons have an extraordinary calming and harmonizing effect. They can harmonize completely all energy fields that are the result of gravity, electromagnetism and weak nuclear force. This reflects practically in a multitude of ways. Tachyon energy harmonizes and enlivens the energy matrix  which shapes all matter and thus also our mental, emotional, etheric and physical bodies. All this greatly affects our physical health and well-being. Since it harmonizes all electromagnetic emissions it is also an excellent protection against all forms of electrosmog. A treatment session inside the Tachyon chamber has irreversible positive effects on all aspects of our being.
The chamber is a relaxing, energetically aligned space where individuals lie down to receive a direct transmission of tachyon energy into their physical and subtle energy bodies. It is private, spacious and comfortable.

✧ How Tachyons Work
Tachyons permanently change the quantum properties of atomic nuclei in matter. While the chemical composition remains the same, these particles decrease the entropy of physical matter—leading to:
Strengthening of the immune system


Reversal or slowing of the aging process


Harmonization of chaotic electromagnetic fields


Structural support for DNA and higher energy bodies


Because tachyons cannot harm, they are safe, neutral, and always work toward the highest good of each individual.

✧ Benefits of Tachyon Energy
Tachyons harmonize imbalanced energy, rejuvenate the body’s energy matrix, and assist in balancing:
Physical health and vitality


Emotional clarity and peace


Mental focus and resilience


Spiritual growth and alignment


Some reported benefits include:
Faster healing after surgery or injury


Relief from chronic pain, arthritis, and inflammation


Reduction in allergies, sensitivities, and eczema


Improved immune response


More restorative sleep


Nervous system regulation and blood pressure balance


Emotional healing: trauma, fear, depression, anxiety


Increased energy, motivation, and mental clarity


Deeper awareness and improved decision-making


Release of outdated beliefs and emotional patterns


Enhanced connection to the higher self


Many clients also describe feeling deep peace, inner balance, and spiritual clarity after a session—leading some to call tachyons the “happiness particles.”
It is most important to try this technology with an open mind and let tachyons speak for themselves


✧ What to Expect in a Session
Sessions last 30 minutes.


You will lie fully clothed in the chamber; light-colored clothing is recommended.


You may meditate, rest, or even nap while receiving tachyon energy.


The experience is gentle, non-invasive, and accumulates over multiple sessions.
The Tachyon Chamber interacts with your unique energy matrix, where you are at in the exact now moment of your session, what is priority for you, and what you are willing and able to receive. Your awareness level of what you are receiving will depend on the brain wave state that you are able to get yourself to during your session.


Initial recommendations:
Begin with 3–6 sessions to experience cumulative results.


Weekly or monthly sessions are encouraged for continued balance.



✧ Spiritual & Cosmic Context
Tachyon energy is used by the Pleiadians and other cosmic civilizations of Light as a source of healing, communication, and propulsion (e.g., hyperdrive energy). These beings are assisting humanity with its spiritual evolution, and a planetary network of Tachyon Chambers is now being constructed to support the shift.
The tachyon belt now surrounding Earth marks a transition between an entropic universe and a syntropic (ordered, harmonic) one. Tachyon Chambers help integrate this shift by anchoring high-frequency cosmic light into the body and biosphere.

✧ Why Tachyon Healing?
Modern life is full of pressures and imbalances. The Tachyon Chamber offers a resonant recalibration—an opportunity to return to your natural state of well-being.
Whether you’re overwhelmed, unwell, or spiritually disconnected, this experience helps you:
Clear energetic blockages


Realign your entire system


Reconnect with your inner peace and purpose


Unlock your natural self-healing intelligence
